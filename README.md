## Data Description

- `Curated Cases/` contains the manual curated cases
  - ROP1Fiexd_final.tsv_test.txt: ring opening with 1 monomer
  - CON1Fiexd_final.tsv_test.txt: condensation with 1 monomer
  - CON2Fiexd_final.tsv_test.txt: condensation with 1 monomer
  - ADD1Fiexd_final.tsv_test.txt: addition with 1 monomer

- `Machine_Learning/Final_Training_Set/`
  - `All_good_train.txt`: all the polymers in the training set
  - `Addition/RingOpening/Condensation1/2_good_train.txt`: the polymers with the reaction type of addition/ring opening/condensation with 1 or 2 monomers
